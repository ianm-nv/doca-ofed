2014-10-23: v2.3
* Added support for kernel 3.12 and newer. No longer supports kernel 2.6.32.
* No longer makes use of symbols not exported by default in 3.x. This
  includes using vm_munmap over do_munmap, zap_vma_ptes over zap_page_range,
  etc. More testing is needed to ensure these replacements are approriate.
  See associated comments.
* Use bash for the test run.sh. The shell is available on all Linux systems
  (ksh is not).
* Rewrite the page table walk code to only walk the page tables once.
* Add support for transparent huge pages.
