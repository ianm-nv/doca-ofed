This package build:
* xpmem: user-space tools
* xpmem-dkms: DKMS packaging
* xpmem-modules: pre-built modules for a specific kernel

By default, the package xpmem-modules will be empty.
However, with the build profile 'modules' (dpkg-buildpackage -Pmodules
or setting DEB_BUILD_PROFILES="modules"), the dkms package is empty and
the modules package includes modules for a kernel. By default, running
kernel (uname -r). But this can be overriden with wither environment
variables KVERSION and KSRC.
